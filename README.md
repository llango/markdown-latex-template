# markdown-latex-template

This repository contains a small "template" for using Markdown with LaTeX on something like Overleaf.

I am a big proponent of Markdown over LaTeX where possible.
When I learned of the `markdown`-package, I decided to give it a go. I have got working most features I could want for a technical document.

Features include code examples, diagrams, images, and tables.
All of these can be captioned and labelled for cross-referencing.
They can even be listed automatically.
You can write footnotes, lists, bold or italic text, or cite bibliography with simple Markdown syntax.
Standard LaTeX is also supported when you need it for equations, particular environments, document styling, or anything else Markdown does not support.

Note that these are the features I wanted for technical documents.
Your use case may be different, but if you need input on adapting this source code to your liking, do not hesitate to send me an email at mumblingdrunkard@protonmail.com.
